# [Portis](https://portis.io)

The Portis platform provides convenient access to the Ethereum network from any web application.

## How does it work?

Your DApp communicates with the Portis SDK using standard [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) API calls, meaning it will work automatically with your existing web application.

Users donâ€™t have to install anything in advance to use your DApp. With Portis, your DApp already comes bundled with a solution by offering them a simple in-browser username/password login method which feels familiar.

## Security
Once a user creates a wallet, it is immediately encrypted using [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode). The Portis server only stores encrypted wallets, so we can enable users to easily use the same account across different devices, all without compromising security. Every transaction is signed **client-side** by the user, meaning Portis only relays signed transactions (i.e it can't modify them).

Our code underwent rigorous third party security audits. It is published open source because we believe that is the best way to reach a truly secure codebase. In addition, we want to involve developers as much as possible and welcome any and all comments / pull requests.

## Installation

Add the Portis SDK to your package.json

    npm install portis

Initialize web3js

```js
const portis = require('portis');

// Checking if Web3 has been injected by the browser (Mist/MetaMask)
if (typeof web3 !== 'undefined') {
    // Use Mist/MetaMask's provider
    web3js = new Web3(web3.currentProvider);
} else {
    // Fallback - use Portis
    web3js = new Web3(new portis.Provider({ network: 'mainnet' }));
}

// Now you can start your app & access web3 freely:
startApp()

})
```

This will set Portis as the fallback for when Mist/MetaMask are unavailable.


If the Portis provider injected properly isPortis will be true

```js
web3.currentProvider.isPortis
```

## Development mode
You can set Portis to work with one of the test networks:
1. ropsten
1. kovan
1. rinkeby

Just change the `network` variable when you initialize the Portis provider:
```js
web3js = new Web3(new portis.Provider({ network: 'ropsten' }));
```
